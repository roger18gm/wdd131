            "O ye, my people, lift up your heads and be comforted; for behold,
            the time is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer
            be in subjection to our enemies, notwithstanding our many
            strugglings, which have been in vain; yet I trust there remaineth
            an effectual struggle to be made. Therefore, lift up your heads,
            and rejoice, and put your trust in God"

        <p>
          "For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which
          is good among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be
          plain unto the children of men; and he inviteth them all to come
          unto him and partake of his goodness; and he denieth none that come
          unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female; and he
          remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God, both Jew and
          Gentile.""
